# Paragraphs Editor Enhancements

The "Paragraphs Editor Enhancements" adds some styling to the modal dialog used
by [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) and
to "Add In Between" provided by
[Paragraphs Features](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs_features).
The module allows you to group Paragraph types in the modal dialog using
categories and uses the images you can add to each Paragraph type for better
recognizability.


## Requirements

This module requires the following modules:

- [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)
- [Paragraphs Features](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs_features)


## Installation

Install as usual, see the documentation page about
[installing drupal modules](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8) for further information.


## Configuration

To make use of the re-styled dialog, configure your Paragraphs widget to use the
modal dialog for adding paragraphs to your content ("Add mode" -> "Modal form").
Enable add in between buttons to see a better editor experience in the widget.

You may choose between displaying the paragraphs as tiles (with optional image
and description) or as a simple list.
