REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the Entity Reference Purger module as you would normally install a 
   contributed Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for 
   further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

For config fields (fields added via Manage fields UI):  
 * Go to an entity reference field settings (e.g. /admin/structure/types/manage/article/fields/node.article.field_tags)
   and check the 'Remove orphaned entity references' checkbox.
 * If you have a lot of dangling references you might want to also enable the
   'Use queue' option for performance reasons.

For base fields:
 * Add the following code to your base field definition:

```
->setSetting('entity_reference_purger', [
  'remove_orphaned' => TRUE,
  'use_queue' => FALSE,
]);
```
